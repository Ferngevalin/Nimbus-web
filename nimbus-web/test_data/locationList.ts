Wat Hua Lamphong was originally called Wat Wua Lamphong, its name comes from a canal also called Khlong of the same name, which is eight kilometers long, running east from the southern part of the Khlong Padung Krung Kasem. Along the canal ran a dirt track called Wua Lamphong Road. Today, Wua Lamphong Road has become one of the busiest streets in Bangkok. It is Rama IV Street, Thanon Phra Ram 4. The temple is located south of Rama IV Street next to Chula High Tech Square between the intersections with Phaya Thai and Si Phraya streets. The Sam Yan stop on the Bangkok Metro is right in front of the temple entrance. Notable is the temple's Ubosot, which stands on a single-story base. A large staircase leads from the entrance of the temple directly into the sanctuary. There are many photo motifs. The temple is also well attended.",
